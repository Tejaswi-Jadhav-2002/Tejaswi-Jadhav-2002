1. Overview
This project focuses on predicting property prices in various districts of California using
several district-level features. By building a predictive model, we aim to identify key variables
that influence housing prices and improve the accuracy of house value predictions. The
project will specifically utilize simple linear regression and multiple linear regression to
address this regression task, ensuring proper data handling and evaluation of the models.

2. Problem Statement
The objective is to predict the median house value in California districts based on features
such as income, the number of rooms, geographical location, and proximity to the ocean.
Given the dataset, we will develop regression models, evaluate their performance, and
determine which model provides the best balance between predictive accuracy and
interpretability.

4. Deliverables
● Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations and summary statistics.
● Data Preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical
variables.
● Model development using:
o Simple Linear Regression
o Multiple Linear Regression
● Evaluation of the models using relevant metrics (Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall,
F1-Score, etc.) where applicable.
● A final, well-documented notebook detailing all steps, insights, and the final model
selection.
